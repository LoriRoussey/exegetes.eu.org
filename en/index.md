The *“exégètes amateurs”* is the nickname given to a group of
activists litigating in France against mass surveillance, data
retention and State censorship on the Internet.

It is a joint initiative between French Data Network (France's oldest
internet access provider, since 1992), La Quadrature du Net and the
federation of non-profit ISPs (FFDN).
